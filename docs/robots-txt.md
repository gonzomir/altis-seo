# Robots.txt

The SEO module will read a custom `robots.txt` file from `/config/robots.txt` in your project's root directory.

The contents of that file will be appended to the `robots.txt` file generated by the CMS. Other components and plugins may add content to `robots.txt` via the `robots_txt` filter.

```php
add_filter( 'robots_txt', function ( string $output ) : string {
	$output .= '
User-agent: *
Disallow: /private
';

	return $output;
} );
```
